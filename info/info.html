          <h2>The Approach</h2>
          <p>
            At its core, Wellness Buddy is built on the belief that wellness
            should be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Accessible</span> - Health shouldn't be complicated or
              expensive
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Personalized</span> - Everyone's wellness journey is unique
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Sustainable</span> - Small, consistent changes lead to
              lasting results
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fun</span> - Taking care of yourself should feel good, not
              like a chore
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>About The Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Wellness Buddy is a personal project born from a passion for both
            technology and wellness. I created this tool to combine my interest
            in retro gaming aesthetics with practical applications that can help
            people live healthier lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project represents my belief that technology should not only
            look cool but also serve a meaningful purpose in our daily lives.
